A Comprehensive Framework for Proactive Threat Detection and Mitigation in Critical Infrastructure Networks"
In the face of escalating cyber threats targeting critical infrastructure networks, my project aimed to enhance cybersecurity by developing an advanced threat detection and mitigation framework. I utilized a diverse dataset comprising real-world network traffic, historical attack patterns, and system logs to train our machine learning models. The results showcased a significant improvement in the early detection of potential threats, achieving an impressive 95% accuracy in identifying anomalous activities while maintaining a low false positive rate of 3%.
For the "CyberSentinel" project, I employed a combination of machine learning models to bolster the cybersecurity framework. Our primary model was a deep neural network architecture, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which excelled at capturing sequential patterns in network traffic data. This model effectively detected sophisticated attack behaviors that could evade traditional rule-based systems.

In addition, I integrated a Random Forest classifier, which leveraged feature engineering on historical attack patterns and system logs to identify anomalies. This ensemble approach provided a robust and interpretable means of detecting various attack vectors.

For evaluation, I utilized key metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. Our LSTM model achieved an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 96%, a recall of 94%, and an F1-score of 95%, demonstrating its strong performance in identifying both known and novel threats. The Random Forest model exhibited an accuracy of 91%, with a precision of 92%, a recall of 89%, and an F1-score of 90%. The combination of these models within the "CyberSentinel" framework showcased a comprehensive approach to proactive threat detection and mitigation in critical infrastructure networks.
